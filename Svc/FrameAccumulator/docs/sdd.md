# Svc::FrameAccumulator

The `Svc::FrameAccumulator` component accumulates a stream of data (sequence of [Fw::Buffer](../../../Fw/Buffer/docs/sdd.md) objects) to extract full frames from.

The `Svc::FrameAccumulator` accepts as input a sequence of byte buffers, which typically come from a ground data system via a [ByteStreamDriver](../../../Drv/ByteStreamDriverModel/docs/sdd.md). It extracts the frames from the sequence of buffers and emits them on the `frameOut` output port.

## Internals

### Overview and configuration

The `Svc::FrameAccumulator` accumulates the [Fw::Buffer](../../../Fw/Buffer/docs/sdd.md) objects into a circular buffer ([Utils::CircularBuffer](../../../Utils/Types/CircularBuffer.hpp)). 

The component must be configured with a [`Svc::FrameDetector`](../FrameDetector.hpp) which is responsible for detecting frames in the circular buffer. An implementation of this for the F´ communications protocol is provided by `Svc::FrameDetectors::FprimeFrameDetector`.

The uplink frames need not be aligned on the buffer boundaries, and each frame may span one or more buffers.

### Frame detection

The `Svc::FrameAccumulator` receives `Fw::Buffer` objects on its `dataIn` input port. These buffers are accumulated in a `Utils::CircularBuffer`. Every time a new buffer is accumulated into the circular buffer, the `Svc::FrameAccumulator` enters a loop to `detect()` a frame within the circular buffer, starting at the current head of the circular buffer. The `Svc::FrameDetector` returns one of three results:

- `NO_FRAME_DETECTED`: indicates no valid frame is present at the head of the circular buffer (for example, start word does not match the current head of the circular buffer). The `Svc::FrameAccumulator` rotates the circular buffer one byte and loops over to `detect()` again, or break the loop if the circular buffer is exhausted.
- `FRAME_DETECTED`: indicates there is a frame at the current head of the circular buffer. The `Svc::FrameAccumulator` allocates a new `Fw::Buffer` object to hold the frame, copies the detected frame from the circular buffer into the new `Fw::Buffer` object, and emits the new `Fw::Buffer` object (containing the frame) on its `frameOut` output port. The `Svc::FrameAccumulator` then rotates the circular buffer to remove the data that was just extracted, and deallocates the original `Fw::Buffer` that was received on the `dataIn` input port.
- `MORE_DATA_NEEDED`: indicates that more data is needed to determine whether there is a valid frame. The `Svc::FrameAccumulator` deallocates the original `Fw::Buffer` that was received on the `dataIn` input port and halts execution, effectively waiting for the next `Fw::Buffer` to be received on the `dataIn` input port.

    box Grey FrameAccumulator
    participant A as Accumulator
    participant D as Detector
    end

    I-->>A: Fw::Buffer
    activate A
    A-->A: Serialize into RingBuffer
    loop 
        A-->>D: detect()
        alt MORE_DATA_NEEDED
            A-->A: break
        else NO_FRAME_DETECTED
            A-->>A: ring.rotate(1)
        else FRAME_DETECTED
            create participant Z as Output
            A-->>Z: Frame
        end
    end
    deactivate A
    destroy O
```

### Cleanup

The `cleanup()` method must be called to deallocate the memory used by the `Svc::FrameAccumulator` component safely before shutdown. This method deallocates the circular buffer that was set up during the `configure()` method.


## Usage Examples

The `Svc::FrameAccumulator` component is used in the uplink stack of many reference F´ application such as [the tutorials source code](https://github.com/fprime-community#tutorials). The below diagram shows the canonical configuration in which it is used.

## Requirements

Requirement | Description | Rationale | Verification Method
----------- | ----------- | ----------| -------------------
SVC-FRAME-ACCUMULATOR-001 | `Svc::FrameAccumulator` shall accumulate a sequence of byte buffers until a full frame is received | FrameAccumulator is designed to re-assemble frames from sequence of bytes | Unit test |
SVC-FRAME-ACCUMULATOR-002 | `Svc::FrameAccumulator` shall detect once the accumulated buffers form a full frame and emit said frame | Pass frames to other parts of the system | Unit test |
SVC-FRAME-ACCUMULATOR-003 | `Svc::FrameAccumulator` shall accept byte buffers containing frames that are not aligned on a buffer boundary. | For flexibility, we do not require that the frames be aligned on a buffer boundary. | Unit test |
SVC-FRAME-ACCUMULATOR-004 | `Svc::FrameAccumulator` shall accept byte buffers containing frames that span one or more buffers. | For flexibility, we do not require each frame to fit in a single buffer. | Unit test |

## Port Descriptions
